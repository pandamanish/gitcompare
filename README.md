# gitcompare
day1: as i am quite friendly with front end part and a bit average knowledge on the backend,on 1st day i started gaining knowledge about how to create the server ,work on it and how to link github api working for it.
started my project by building the front layout of the page and the 2nd task was about it to act responsive.
then started working on creating server so i found xampp software to create my localhost.
day2:my 2nd challenge was to gain knowledge on how to connect the githubapi to php .
learnt about git bash to get all the info from the link provided.
while i was connecting the url to grab details.it showed an error for not allowing http request and all.
so after huge no search i came to know about curl and its application which helped me collecting/grabbing the info.
